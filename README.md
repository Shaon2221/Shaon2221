## ‚öôÔ∏è Shaon Sikder ‚Äî AI Engineer (GenAI & MLOps)

I help teams ship production‚Äëgrade LLM features fast ‚Äî and safely. From fine‚Äëtuning and agents to advanced RAG and AWS/K8s deployments, I build systems that move metrics (engagement up, errors down, time‚Äëto‚Äëvalue short).

I care about fast feedback loops, clear communication, and measurable impact.

### How I can help
- Design & ship LLM copilots/agents (LangGraph, CrewAI, LangChain) that actually close loops
- Fine‚Äëtune and optimize models (GRPO/DPO, LoRA/PEFT, quantization) for cost and latency
- Build advanced RAG with evals and guardrails (ChromaDB/Milvus/Pinecone + tracing)
- Production MLOps: Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Jenkins), MLflow/DVC on AWS

### Proof in outcomes
- +20% user engagement with a fine‚Äëtuned Llama chatbot (Easital)
- ‚àí35% OCR errors via computer vision improvements (Easital)
- +10% lift vs betting odds with esports prediction (Opus)
- ‚àí20% simulated risk using social network analysis (Piana)

### Recent work
- Short Circuit Science (2024‚ÄìNow): medical imaging & sports analytics; multi‚Äëagent copilots; advanced RAG; API backends; AWS/K8s
- Actionboard.ai / Deep Data Lab (Contract): MCP servers for real‚Äëtime intent, knowledge graphs; robust MLOps
- Delineate (Contract): AI agents for drug discovery; on‚Äëprem LLM search for PK/PD data

### Tooling I trust
Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit‚Äëlearn, FastAPI/Flask/Django, SQL/PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (EC2, S3, SageMaker, Lambda), MLflow, DVC

### Also teaching & building in public
- Instructor: Generative AI (Horizon Solutions, 2024) ‚Ä¢ Fundamentals of AI (Skill Hunt, 2021)
- Creator: Data Discovery ‚Äî practical GenAI tutorials and experiments

### Research (ongoing)
Transfer learning for bone marrow classification ‚Ä¢ Thermal comfort ML + XAI ‚Ä¢ Federated learning in smart buildings

### Education
BSc, Information & Communication Engineering ‚Äî East West University (GPA 3.46/4.0)
